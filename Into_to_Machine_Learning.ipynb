The company would like to recommend one of their newer data plans to each legacy plan user, but Megaline also wants to ensure the recommended plan is the most desirable for each customer. The request has been made to train a model that will determine which new Megaline data plan (Smart or Ultra) be recommended to each customer based on their data usage behavior.\n",

The number of estimators equates to the number of \"trees in the forest\", or in layman's terms, the number of decision trees in the model. To determine the hyperparamters that result in the best trained random forest model, models will be trained and tested with various combinations of values for both the depth and number of estimators.

The decision tree model and random forest model with the highest accuracy were then tested using the testing data. The accuracy of the best decision tree model was calculated to be **77.92%**, and the accuracy of the best random forest model was calculated to be **79.94%**. Both models surpass the **75%** accuracy threshold. The best random forest model is slightly more accurate than the best decision tree model, so that should be the model delivered to Megaline."
